# Roblox Account Manager 3.7.1

✔️ Added support for new private server links

✔️ Added account-specific FPS caps

✔️ Fixed launching multiple accounts

✔️ Fixed Use Old Join, don't know why people use this but it's fixed now

✔️ Updated Games list to use new endpoints to search

✔️ Removed Load Region as it no longer works since most Roblox servers now have DDoS protection

✔️  Removed Asynchronous Launching since the Roblox process is directly launched now instead of a separate launcher


Not sure what's broken right now so this wont be fully released yet

This update contains some random un-used & un-finished code that will be removed in the next update.
